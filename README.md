# X(cross)-Reference Checker
A python script project to extract and check and cross references from scientific papers in PDF format.
This script is created and maintained with the intention of extracting automatically and compare references to help developing literature review projects.

Examples of its use and the type of reviews for which it could be useful include: 
- Systematic Reviews
- Meta-analysis
- Network meta-analysis
- Umbrella analysis

The main need and research approach for its development was to explore systematic reviews and meta-analysis that are cited in clinical practice guidelines. It has also been helpful when developing scoping reviews as well as other "meta" research such as "review of reviews".
